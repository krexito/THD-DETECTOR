## Architecture (v2 — Pure Measurement)

### Design Concept
- **Channel plugins** = passive THD analyzers inserted on each channel strip
  - Measure THD, THD+N, harmonics H2–H8 from signal level
  - Display: arc gauge, THD+N readout, VU meter, status badge
  - NO drive/saturation/character controls — zero signal coloring
- **Master Brain plugin** = inserted on the mixbus
  - Receives all channel measurement data
  - Displays: master THD gauge, channel table (THD/THD+N/dominant harmonic/level), harmonic spectrum H2–H8, rolling THD history timeline, alert indicator

### VST Plugin Communication System
The VST plugins communicate using MIDI System Exclusive messages:
- **Channel Strip Mode**: Each plugin instance sends THD data via MIDI to the Master Brain
- **Master Brain Mode**: Receives MIDI data from all Channel Strip plugins
- **Protocol**: Custom SysEx (0xF0 0x7D 0x01 ...) containing channel ID, THD, THD+N, level, peak, harmonics
- **Implementation**: `THDDataMessage` struct with MIDI serialization/deserialization

### ChannelData Interface
```ts
interface ChannelData {
  id: string; name: string;
  thd: number; thdN: number;
  level: number; peakLevel: number;
  harmonics: number[];   // H2–H8
  muted: boolean; soloed: boolean;
  color: string;
}
```
(Removed: drive, saturation, character)

### Engine
- `FFTAnalyzer` class — Real FFT analysis using Web Audio API AnalyserNode
  - FFT size: 32768 bins for high resolution
  - Interpolated peak detection for precision
  - Fundamental frequency detection (20Hz-2kHz range)
  - Harmonic analysis H2-H8
  - Automatic noise floor estimation
- `measureTHD(level, channelId, time)` — fallback simulation (deprecated)
- `computeMasterTHD(channels)` — RSS aggregation, returns worstChannel
- `useAudioEngine(channels, onUpdate)` — real-time FFT analysis loop

## Current Focus

**VST Plugin Development (JUCE)**
- Created VST3 plugin project structure using JUCE framework
- Ported FFT analysis logic from TypeScript to C++
- Implemented 8-channel THD analyzer in native code
- Using JUCE DSP FFT module (8192 size)
- Next: Add plugin UI and test functionality

**Web Version**: Maintained for testing and demo purposes

## Session History

| Date | Changes |
|------|---------|
| Initial | Template created with base setup |
| Session 1 | THD Analyzer v1 — NLS Summer with drive/saturation/character controls |
| Session 2 | THD Analyzer v2 — Pure measurement architecture, Master Brain plugin |
| Session 3 | THD Analyzer v3 — Real FFT analysis using Web Audio API AnalyserNode |
| Session 4 | VST Plugin Development — Started native VST3 plugin with JUCE framework |

| Session 5 | VST3 stabilization pass — fixed JUCE/CMake integration issues, repaired processor syntax/logic errors, added FIFO-based FFT windowing and safer SysEx serialization for channel/master communication |
| Session 6 | Merge-conflict cleanup pass — verified repository has no unresolved conflict markers and documented PR merge readiness status |
| Session 7 | VST plugin branding update — changed JUCE `PRODUCT_NAME` to `THD - TotalHarmonicDisplay` so hosts display the new plugin name |
| Session 8 | Audio-thread safety hardening pass — removed per-block allocations in `processBlock`, added reusable scratch buffers, and ensured Master mode clears consumed MIDI to avoid forwarding stale SysEx events |

| Session 9 | VST automation/state pass — moved host-visible settings to `AudioProcessorValueTreeState` (plugin mode, channel ID, mute/solo flags), switched state save/restore to APVTS ValueTree, and added atomic cached reads for audio-thread-safe parameter access. |
| Session 9 | Initialization and debug workflow pass — documented Visual Studio/Xcode auto-launch setup for AudioPluginHost and centralized processor state clearing via `reset()` for clean plugin starts |
| Session 10 | PR conflict-support docs pass — added step-by-step local merge conflict resolution workflow and marker sanity check to VST local build guide |
| Session 11 | PR #7 follow-up hardening — cached APVTS raw parameter pointers and listener-driven cache sync to remove per-block parameter lookups in `processBlock`, plus legacy `THDAnalyzerSettings` XML migration into current mute/solo APVTS parameters during state restore. |
| Session 11 | VST build-fix pass — replaced umbrella JUCE include with explicit `juce_audio_utils` + `juce_dsp` headers, corrected `createEditor()` to construct `GenericAudioProcessorEditor` with `*this`, and added `JUCE_VST3_CAN_REPLACE_VST2=0` compile definition in CMake. |


| Session 12 | JUCE UI implementation pass — replaced GenericAudioProcessorEditor with a custom `THDAnalyzerPluginEditor`, added THD Analyzer v2.0 native layout (sticky header, scrollable channel cards, master brain placeholders), and wired CMake to compile the new editor source files. |
| Session 13 | PR #10 follow-up fix pass — bound custom editor controls to APVTS parameters (plugin mode, channel ID, per-channel mute/solo) and removed randomized THD display updates in favor of processor analysis/channel data snapshots. |
| Session 14 | VST editor compile-fix pass — made `CanvasPlaceholder` inherit `juce::SettableTooltipClient` so tooltip updates in `timerCallback()` compile correctly with JUCE. |


| Session 15 | VST3 bus-layout compatibility pass — aligned processor bus declaration, `isBusesLayoutSupported`, and JUCE `PLUGIN_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATIONS` to stereo-only `{2,2}` to prevent host scan-time null-component channel queries. |

| Session 16 | VST3 scan-compat follow-up — tightened `isBusesLayoutSupported` to reject non-main/aux bus layouts and disabled buses, keeping runtime acceptance strictly aligned to a single stereo input/output bus. |

| Session 17 | VST GUI crash fix pass — clamped animated header pulse alpha into [0,1] before `withAlpha()` to avoid JUCE debug assertion breaks in host paint loop. |
| Session 18 | VST editor UX pass — replaced temporary canvas placeholders (waveform/gauge/harmonic/history) with live-rendered analyzer widgets driven by processor analysis snapshots. |
| Session 19 | Dynamic channel-topology pass — converted VST channel registry from fixed 8 pre-seeded channels to runtime-discovered channels (created on incoming SysEx), added stale-channel pruning, expanded Channel ID selection to 64 IDs, wired header add/remove channel buttons to real processor actions, and refreshed editor cards from live channel snapshots so Channel Strip ↔ Master Brain behavior matches dynamic DAW routing. |
| Session 20 | VST GUI callback lifetime hardening — replaced raw `this` captures in channel remove/add callbacks with `juce::Component::SafePointer` guards to avoid use-after-free during click dispatch while cards/editor are rebuilt. |
| Session 21 | Master Brain UX alignment pass — removed manual Add/Remove channel controls from the VST editor so channel cards are read-only and sourced only from auto-detected channel instances (snapshot/SysEx discovery). |
| Session 22 | Master Brain display stabilization pass — removed animated HeaderBar MEASURING pulse (static indicator to avoid visual artifacting) and added gated attack/release smoothing for displayed THD+N/history values to reduce erratic meter jumps on low-level/noisy input. |
| Session 23 | Web Audio analyzer stability fix — tracked both primary and detune oscillators per channel so `stopSignal()`/`dispose()` stop every started oscillator, preventing leaked audio nodes and improving repeated analyzer start/stop behavior. |
| Session 24 | VST Master Brain readability pass — added Fast/Legible display-speed modes with smoothing for AVG/MASTER/PEAK/FLOOR/THD+N + harmonic bars, and removed the Channel ID dropdown from the header UI to avoid the large manual channel list. |
| Session 25 | VST GUI visual-alignment pass — restyled header/channel cards/master panel to match the provided NLS Summer reference look (title treatment, status pill, 3-column master layout, richer section labels, and peak-channel footer) while preserving existing analyzer behavior and smoothing controls. |
| Session 26 | VST CPU-optimization pass — reduced per-instance audio-thread load by throttling FFT analysis to hop intervals (25% overlap), skipping analyzer runs in Master Brain mode, preallocating FFT magnitude storage, and reusing precomputed harmonic bins inside THD/THD+N computation. |
| Session 27 | VST mode/connection fix pass — made Channel Strip vs Master Brain UI visibly switch layouts, hid master-only channel list in strip mode, and added shared in-process channel telemetry fallback so Master Brain can show Channel Strip metrics even when host MIDI routing is unavailable. |
| Session 28 | VST real-time performance pass — removed dynamic harmonic-vector allocations by switching analysis harmonics to fixed arrays, added lock-free audio-thread reuse of the latest analysis snapshot for Channel Strip telemetry, and optimized FIFO writes with chunked copy to reduce per-sample ring-buffer overhead. |
| Session 29 | VST mode-label and stale-telemetry fix pass — renamed plugin mode label from "Channel Strip" to "Channel" and prevented Master Brain from showing phantom channels by consuming shared channel updates only when sequence changes and clearing shared state on Channel instances during reset/channel-ID changes. |
| Session 30 | VST shared-telemetry safety follow-up — removed channel-ID-triggered global shared-state clearing (which could affect other instances), restored `ensureChannelExists` on channel ID changes, and added wall-clock freshness gating (`lastPublishMs`) in Master Brain ingestion to ignore stale phantom telemetry. |
| Session 31 | VST phantom-self-ingest fix — added per-instance IDs to shared telemetry and made Master Brain ignore updates published by the same plugin instance, preventing a newly switched Brain instance from showing its own prior Channel-mode data as a phantom channel. |
| Session 32 | VST FFT math optimization pass — switched spectral storage to magnitude-squared bins so fundamental search and noise accumulation avoid per-bin `sqrt`, computing square roots only for displayed harmonic amplitudes and final THD/THD+N ratios. |
| Session 33 | THD math-validation pass — extracted pure THD math helpers (linear-amplitude THD ratio/dB conversion, harmonic bin mapping with optional alias folding, and Goertzel-vs-DFT power parity checks), updated Web FFT analyzer to derive harmonics from integer multiples H2–H9 while skipping >Nyquist bins, and added Bun reference tests for 1 kHz/2 kHz synthetic validation (expected 10% / -20 dB). |
| Session 34 | THD analyzer accuracy follow-up — added Hann coherent-gain-aware RMS tone estimation from time-domain data, switched web analyzer THD to RMS-domain harmonic ratios (H2–H8) with leakage-resistant projection at detected frequencies, updated THD+N to residual RMS formulation, and expanded math tests for Hann scaling and RMS-vs-peak consistency. |
| Session 35 | THD math consistency follow-up — aligned THD+N residual math to the same Hann-windowed RMS reference system as tone extraction via compensated window RMS gain, added explicit residual clamp regression coverage, and introduced a subharmonic guard in fundamental detection to reduce octave-mislock harmonic mapping errors. |
| Session 36 | VST GUI/audio-thread sync pass — added an `AbstractFifo` lock-free analysis snapshot ring buffer so the audio thread publishes THD analysis for asynchronous GUI consumption, added outbound meta parameters (`thdOutbound`, `thdNOutbound`) pushed via `setValueNotifyingHost`, and refined visualization semantics with even/odd harmonic color coding plus smoothed inverse-style VU ballistics in channel cards. |
| Session 37 | VST outbound-parameter throttling pass — rate-limited host notifications for `thdOutbound`/`thdNOutbound` to ~30 Hz with change-threshold gating, reducing audio-thread event pressure and jitter risk while preserving responsive telemetry. |
| Session 38 | VST non-stationary-readability pass — added fundamental validity gating (min -60 dBFS and min fundamental-power ratio) with confidence reporting in analysis snapshots, rate-limited audio→GUI snapshot publishing to a configurable 25 Hz target, moved THD/THD+N ballistic smoothing to GUI thread (120 ms attack / 700 ms release) with optional "--" display on no valid lock, and switched outbound host parameter notifications to use smoothed display values with ≤30 Hz + 0.1 threshold throttling. |
| Session 39 | Master Brain aggregation fix — switched Master-mode GUI metrics to aggregate live channel telemetry (RSS THD/THD+N + average harmonics), treated populated channel snapshots as valid master input so values no longer freeze at 0, and updated peak/average labels to track channel distortion instead of the local analyzer stream. |
| Session 40 | Master Brain spectrum hotspot visualization — upgraded harmonic panel to a THD hotspot spectrum in Master mode, tinting each harmonic bar by the dominant contributing channel color and scaling glow intensity by contribution so the GUI highlights where distortion is strongest. |
